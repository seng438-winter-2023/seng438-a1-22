# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

In exploratory testing, the tests are created by exploring the functionalities of the software while simultaneously executing the tests. Exploratory testing is an unscripted testing strategy, whereas manual functional testing is a scripted testing method. In manual functional testing the tests are designed and recorded first and may be executed later in the testing process. Exploratory testing is more time consuming because every function will need to be tested without any direction but with manual testing you will also miss the same bugs everytime because the script does not change.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

We divided into two pairs for the pair testing where the test cases were divided equally between pairs. For the manual testing there were 40 test cases and each group member tested 10.
