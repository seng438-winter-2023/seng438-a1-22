# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In order to carry out our plan of exploratory testing, we need to know the requirements of the system we are testing. To do so, we will thoroughly go over the requirements from the client to ensure the application is up to par. To perform our testing, we will test all the required functionalities to ensure the system behaves properly. We will also test most functions extensively and check as many paths as possible to ensure edge cases are caught as well.
