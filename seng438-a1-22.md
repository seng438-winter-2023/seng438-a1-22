# Introduction

The lab that we completed was designed to familiarize ourselves with software testing. This included beginning to work with System under test (SUT) and defect tracking systems. Additionally, we were required to learn more in-depth about and use testing methods such as 
Exploratory (manual non-scripted), and Manual scripted testing, and then finally work with regression testing, where we retested the system after we added changes.

Initially, our group members had different understandings of what these two testing methods would entail, and after a small discussion we were able to get an understanding of where we were before beginning the lab. Our initial understanding of exploratory testing was that test cases wouldn’t be created beforehand but while following the requirements you would check the system and create the tests on the “fly”. For manual scripted testing we believed that it was simply where no automation was involved and that the programmer themselves would contribute to writing the tests and then creating the scripts.

    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
