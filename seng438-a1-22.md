# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab



# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In order to carry out our plan of exploratory testing, we need to know the requirements of the system we are testing. To do so, we will thoroughly go over the requirements from the client to ensure the application is up to par. To perform our testing, we will test all the required functionalities to ensure the system behaves properly. We will also test most functions extensively and check as many paths as possible to ensure edge cases are caught as well.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

In exploratory testing, the tests are created by exploring the functionalities of the software while simultaneously executing the tests. Exploratory testing is an unscripted testing strategy, whereas manual functional testing is a scripted testing method. In manual functional testing the tests are designed and recorded first and may be executed later in the testing process. Exploratory testing is more time consuming because every function will need to be tested without any direction but with manual testing you will also miss the same bugs everytime because the script does not change.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Since we had a group of 4, we divided into two pairs for the pair testing. This allowed us to find more bugs during the exploratory stage both pairs were working concurrently. Since there were 40 test cases in the test suite, we were able to evenly distribute the load between the two pairs since each pair could do 20 test cases each. Overall, we were able to split the work evenly.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

- The structure of the assignment doc was very well organized
- It would have been simpler if the final report wasn’t in a markdown file since it was difficult coordinating adding content to one file
- The description for some sections was kind of vague and made it difficult to understand what to do
